<h1>KPMG Test Project - Companies Map</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<h3>The Product</h3>

<p>The specifications provided by KPMG requires a responsive mobile first web app that will use a map to display all the companies within the endpoint provided. When a user clicks one of the companies plotted on the map more details about the company will be provided. KPMG also requires that all companies can be viewed on a table which can be filtered through. I will achieve this by providing a button to be able to switch between map view and table view. This app will be usable on all modern browsers.</p>
